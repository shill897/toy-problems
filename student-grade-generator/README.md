Student Grade Generator

Description

This is a simple javascript program that prompts the user to input student marks and calculates the corresponding grades based on the following criteria:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

The program takes an input mark from the user, validates it to be within the range of 0 to 100, and then determines the appropriate grade for the input mark.

Usage

 Clone the repository to your local machine.
 Open the javascript file, `student_grade_generator.`, in your preferred javascript development environment.
 Run the program.
 Enter a student's mark when prompted.
 The program will display the corresponding grade for the input mark.
