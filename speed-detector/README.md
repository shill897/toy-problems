Speed Detector

Description

This JavaScript program is designed to detect the speed of a car and calculate demerit points for the driver based on the following rules:

- If the car's speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok."
- For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
- If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, it prints "License suspended."
